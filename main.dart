ðŸ§­ GUBLYGOOP LESSON STRUCTURE â€“ MASTER PRINCIPLES
ðŸ”¹ 1. Teach, Don't Test
We never throw content at learners. We guide them, step by step, with full understanding. No surprises. No stress.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Reinforce, Don't Reset
Every lesson builds directly on what came before. Old phrases are used naturally inside new ones. Nothing is forgotten.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Flow Like Real Speech
All lines are taught as full phrases, spoken aloud. Everything is in context â€” no vocabulary isolation, no grammar tables upfront.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Model, Correct, Repeat
Maria and Kenji model. Sometimes they make a mistake.
We correct them, then have the learner say it cleanly after that. This teaches through comparison and boosts confidence.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Speak Immediately
The learner is always speaking. After 2â€“3 guided examples, theyâ€™re asked to repeat â€” then combine â€” then improvise. This is mastery.
